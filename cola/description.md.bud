The extensibility is used in **MulleObjCStandardFoundation** to add the
'@' conversion character for object conversion.

mulle-sprintf can handle **varargs** and **mulle_vararg** style variable
arguments. Because floating point to string conversion is hard, floating point
conversions are handed down to `sprintf`. So it is not a sprintf replacement.
